# Web-Design_Challenge

This week- we learned how to create a reactive html webpage that can be fluid for different types of screen sizes.
The links below will show different pages of variables that affect weather. 

I really enjoyed this particular week as the learning can be related to my daily duties. It was difficult however
to play with the css style page files to ensure that the web page was aesthetically pleasing.
